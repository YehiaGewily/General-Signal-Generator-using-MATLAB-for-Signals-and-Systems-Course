## Features
1. **Signal Generation**:
   - Supports the generation of various signal types: DC, Ramp, Polynomial, Exponential, Sinusoidal, Sinc, and Triangle.
   - Allows users to specify signal parameters such as amplitude, frequency, phase, and more.
   - Signal intervals are defined by user-input breakpoints, enabling complex piecewise signal construction.

2. **Signal Operations**:
   - Provides several operations to manipulate signals: Scale, Reverse, Shift, Expand, Compress, Clip, and Derivative.
   - Each operation is applied interactively, and the resulting signal is displayed visually for comparison.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - User inputs are collected for sampling frequency, time scale, breakpoints, and signal type parameters.
   - Operations can be applied iteratively until the user decides to stop, with the option to view both the original and modified signals at any time.

4. **Immediate Visualization**:
   - The generated signals and any modifications are plotted immediately, offering users a clear visual representation of the signal's behavior.
   - This feature is key for understanding the impact of different signal operations and transformations.

## Program Structure
### 1. `main.m`
The **main** function coordinates the signal generation and modification process:
- Collects user inputs for signal parameters.
- Generates the initial signal based on these parameters.
- Allows users to apply various operations to the signal in a loop until they choose to stop.
- Plots both the original and modified signals for comparison.

### 2. `getUserInputs.m`
This function gathers all necessary inputs from the user, including:
- Sampling frequency (Fs)
- Start and end times for the time scale
- Number of breakpoints and their positions
- Type of signal and its specific parameters (e.g., amplitude, frequency, etc.)

### 3. `generateSignal.m`
The signal is constructed using user-defined breakpoints to divide the time scale into intervals. For each interval, the signal type and parameters are chosen dynamically by the user.

### 4. `applyOperations.m`
Modifies the signal based on the userâ€™s choice of operations, such as scaling or shifting. The modified signal is plotted after each operation for immediate feedback.

### 5. `plotSignal.m`
Helper function to plot the signals with appropriate labels, ensuring that users can visualize both the original and modified signals.

### 6. `computeDerivative.m`
This function calculates the derivative of the signal using a central difference method, providing a more accurate and stable estimate compared to basic differentiation techniques.
